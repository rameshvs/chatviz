Conversation with Juliet at Sat 01 Jun 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(01:00:00 AM) Juliet:  What storm is this that blows so contrary?
(01:20:00 AM) Juliet: Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
(01:40:00 AM) Juliet: My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
(02:00:00 AM) Juliet: Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
(02:20:00 AM) Juliet: For who is living, if those two are gone?
(04:00:00 AM) Juliet:  O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
(05:20:00 AM) Juliet:  O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
(05:40:00 AM) Juliet: Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
(06:00:00 AM) Juliet: Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
(06:20:00 AM) Juliet: Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
(06:40:00 AM) Juliet: Despised substance of divinest show!
(07:00:00 AM) Juliet: Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
(07:20:00 AM) Juliet: A damned saint, an honourable villain!
(07:40:00 AM) Juliet: O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
(08:00:00 AM) Juliet: When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
(08:20:00 AM) Juliet: In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
(08:40:00 AM) Juliet: Was ever book containing such vile matter
(09:00:00 AM) Juliet: So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
(09:20:00 AM) Juliet: In such a gorgeous palace!
(12:20:00 PM) Juliet:  Blister'd be thy tongue
(12:40:00 PM) Juliet: For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
(01:00:00 PM) Juliet: Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
(01:20:00 PM) Juliet: For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
(01:40:00 PM) Juliet: Sole monarch of the universal earth.
(02:00:00 PM) Juliet: O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
(03:20:00 PM) Juliet:  Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
(03:40:00 PM) Juliet: Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
(04:00:00 PM) Juliet: When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
(04:20:00 PM) Juliet: But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
(04:40:00 PM) Juliet: That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
(05:00:00 PM) Juliet: Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
(05:20:00 PM) Juliet: Your tributary drops belong to woe,
(05:40:00 PM) Juliet: Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
(06:00:00 PM) Juliet: My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
(06:20:00 PM) Juliet: And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
(06:40:00 PM) Juliet: All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
(07:00:00 PM) Juliet: Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
(07:20:00 PM) Juliet: That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
(07:40:00 PM) Juliet: But O, it presses to my memory
(08:00:00 PM) Juliet: Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
(08:20:00 PM) Juliet: 'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
(08:40:00 PM) Juliet: That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
(09:00:00 PM) Juliet: Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
(09:20:00 PM) Juliet: Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
(09:40:00 PM) Juliet: Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
(10:00:00 PM) Juliet: And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
(10:20:00 PM) Juliet: Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
(10:40:00 PM) Juliet: Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
(11:00:00 PM) Juliet: Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
(11:20:00 PM) Juliet: But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
(11:40:00 PM) Juliet: 'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
(12:00:00 AM) Juliet: Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
