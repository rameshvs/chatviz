Conversation with Juliet at Thu 16 May 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
(01:00:00 AM) Romeo:  With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
(01:20:00 AM) Romeo: For stony limits cannot hold love out,
(01:40:00 AM) Romeo: And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
(02:00:00 AM) Romeo: Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
(02:40:00 AM) Juliet:  If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
(03:20:00 AM) Romeo:  Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
(03:40:00 AM) Romeo: Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
(04:00:00 AM) Romeo: And I am proof against their enmity.
(04:40:00 AM) Juliet:  I would not for the world they saw thee here.
(05:20:00 AM) Romeo:  I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
(05:40:00 AM) Romeo: And but thou love me, let them find me here.
(06:00:00 AM) Romeo: My life were better ended by their hate
(06:20:00 AM) Romeo: Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
(07:00:00 AM) Juliet:  By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
(07:40:00 AM) Romeo:  By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
(08:00:00 AM) Romeo: He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
(08:20:00 AM) Romeo: I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
(08:40:00 AM) Romeo: As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
(09:00:00 AM) Romeo: I would adventure for such merchandise.
(09:40:00 AM) Juliet:  Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
(10:00:00 AM) Juliet: Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
(10:20:00 AM) Juliet: For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
(10:40:00 AM) Juliet: Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
(11:00:00 AM) Juliet: What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
(11:20:00 AM) Juliet: Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
(11:40:00 AM) Juliet: And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
(12:00:00 PM) Juliet: Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
(12:20:00 PM) Juliet: They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
(12:40:00 PM) Juliet: If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
(01:00:00 PM) Juliet: Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
(01:20:00 PM) Juliet: I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
(01:40:00 PM) Juliet: So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
(02:00:00 PM) Juliet: In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
(02:20:00 PM) Juliet: And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
(02:40:00 PM) Juliet: But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
(03:00:00 PM) Juliet: Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
(03:20:00 PM) Juliet: I should have been more strange, I must confess,
(03:40:00 PM) Juliet: But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
(04:00:00 PM) Juliet: My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
(04:20:00 PM) Juliet: And not impute this yielding to light love,
(04:40:00 PM) Juliet: Which the dark night hath so discovered.
(05:20:00 PM) Romeo:  Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
(05:40:00 PM) Romeo: That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
(06:20:00 PM) Juliet:  O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
(06:40:00 PM) Juliet: That monthly changes in her circled orb,
(07:00:00 PM) Juliet: Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
(07:40:00 PM) Romeo:  What shall I swear by?
(08:20:00 PM) Juliet:  Do not swear at all;
(08:40:00 PM) Juliet: Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
(09:00:00 PM) Juliet: Which is the god of my idolatry,
(09:20:00 PM) Juliet: And I'll believe thee.
(10:00:00 PM) Romeo:  If my heart's dear love-
(10:40:00 PM) Juliet:  Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
(11:00:00 PM) Juliet: I have no joy of this contract to-night.
(11:20:00 PM) Juliet: It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
(11:40:00 PM) Juliet: Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
(12:00:00 AM) Juliet: Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
