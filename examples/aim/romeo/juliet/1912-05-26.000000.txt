Conversation with Juliet at Sun 26 May 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(04:20:00 AM) Romeo:  Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
(04:40:00 AM) Romeo: It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
(05:00:00 AM) Romeo: That one short minute gives me in her sight.
(05:20:00 AM) Romeo: Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
(05:40:00 AM) Romeo: Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
(06:00:00 AM) Romeo: It is enough I may but call her mine.
(12:00:00 PM) Juliet:  Good even to my ghostly confessor.
(01:20:00 PM) Juliet:  As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
(02:00:00 PM) Romeo:  Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
(02:20:00 PM) Romeo: Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
(02:40:00 PM) Romeo: To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
(03:00:00 PM) Romeo: This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
(03:20:00 PM) Romeo: Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
(03:40:00 PM) Romeo: Receive in either by this dear encounter.
(04:20:00 PM) Juliet:  Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
(04:40:00 PM) Juliet: Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
(05:00:00 PM) Juliet: They are but beggars that can count their worth;
(05:20:00 PM) Juliet: But my true love is grown to such excess
(05:40:00 PM) Juliet: cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
