(06:00:00 AM) Juliet:  Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
(06:20:00 AM) Juliet: That sees into the bottom of my grief?
(06:40:00 AM) Juliet: O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
(07:00:00 AM) Juliet: Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
(07:20:00 AM) Juliet: Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
(07:40:00 AM) Juliet: In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
(09:20:00 AM) Juliet:  O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
(09:40:00 AM) Juliet: My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
(10:00:00 AM) Juliet: How shall that faith return again to earth
(10:20:00 AM) Juliet: Unless that husband send it me from heaven
(10:40:00 AM) Juliet: By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
(11:00:00 AM) Juliet: Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
(11:20:00 AM) Juliet: Upon so soft a subject as myself!
(11:40:00 AM) Juliet: What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
(12:00:00 PM) Juliet: Some comfort, nurse.
(05:40:00 PM) Juliet:  Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
(07:00:00 PM) Juliet:  Amen!
(08:20:00 PM) Juliet:  Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
(08:40:00 PM) Juliet: Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
(09:00:00 PM) Juliet: Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
(09:20:00 PM) Juliet: To make confession and to be absolv'd.
(10:40:00 PM) Juliet:  Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
(11:00:00 PM) Juliet: Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
(11:20:00 PM) Juliet: Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
(11:40:00 PM) Juliet: Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
(12:00:00 AM) Juliet: So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
