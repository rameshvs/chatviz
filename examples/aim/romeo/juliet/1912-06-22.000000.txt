Conversation with Juliet at Sat 22 Jun 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(03:40:00 AM) Romeo:  Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
(04:00:00 AM) Romeo: Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
(04:20:00 AM) Romeo: See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
(04:40:00 AM) Romeo: Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
(05:00:00 AM) Romeo: Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
(05:20:00 AM) Romeo: And do not interrupt me in my course.
(05:40:00 AM) Romeo: Why I descend into this bed of death
(06:00:00 AM) Romeo: Is partly to behold my lady's face,
(06:20:00 AM) Romeo: But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
(06:40:00 AM) Romeo: A precious ring- a ring that I must use
(07:00:00 AM) Romeo: In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
(07:20:00 AM) Romeo: But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
(07:40:00 AM) Romeo: In what I farther shall intend to do,
(08:00:00 AM) Romeo: By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
(08:20:00 AM) Romeo: And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
(08:40:00 AM) Romeo: The time and my intents are savage-wild,
(09:00:00 AM) Romeo: More fierce and more inexorable far
(09:20:00 AM) Romeo: Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
(10:40:00 AM) Romeo:  So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
(11:00:00 AM) Romeo: Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
(12:40:00 PM) Romeo:  Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
(01:00:00 PM) Romeo: Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
(01:20:00 PM) Romeo: Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
(01:40:00 PM) Romeo: And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
(02:00:00 PM) Romeo: Romeo opens the tomb.
(06:00:00 PM) Romeo:  I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
(06:20:00 PM) Romeo: Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
(06:40:00 PM) Romeo: Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
(07:00:00 PM) Romeo: Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
(07:20:00 PM) Romeo: But not another sin upon my head
(07:40:00 PM) Romeo: By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
(08:00:00 PM) Romeo: By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
(08:20:00 PM) Romeo: For I come hither arm'd against myself.
(08:40:00 PM) Romeo: Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
(09:00:00 PM) Romeo: A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
(10:40:00 PM) Romeo:  Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
(11:00:00 PM) Romeo: They fight.
