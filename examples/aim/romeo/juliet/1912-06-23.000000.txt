Conversation with Juliet at Sun 23 Jun 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(01:20:00 AM) Romeo:  In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
(01:40:00 AM) Romeo: Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
(02:00:00 AM) Romeo: What said my man when my betossed soul
(02:20:00 AM) Romeo: Did not attend him as we rode? I think
(02:40:00 AM) Romeo: He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
(03:00:00 AM) Romeo: Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
(03:20:00 AM) Romeo: Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
(03:40:00 AM) Romeo: To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
(04:00:00 AM) Romeo: One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
(04:20:00 AM) Romeo: I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
(04:40:00 AM) Romeo: A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
(05:00:00 AM) Romeo: For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
(05:20:00 AM) Romeo: This vault a feasting presence full of light.
(05:40:00 AM) Romeo: Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
(06:00:00 AM) Romeo: [Lays him in the tomb.]
(06:20:00 AM) Romeo: How oft when men are at the point of death
(06:40:00 AM) Romeo: Have they been merry! which their keepers call
(07:00:00 AM) Romeo: A lightning before death. O, how may I
(07:20:00 AM) Romeo: Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
(07:40:00 AM) Romeo: Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
(08:00:00 AM) Romeo: Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
(08:20:00 AM) Romeo: Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
(08:40:00 AM) Romeo: Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
(09:00:00 AM) Romeo: And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
(09:20:00 AM) Romeo: Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
(09:40:00 AM) Romeo: O, what more favour can I do to thee
(10:00:00 AM) Romeo: Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
(10:20:00 AM) Romeo: To sunder his that was thine enemy?
(10:40:00 AM) Romeo: Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
(11:00:00 AM) Romeo: Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
(11:20:00 AM) Romeo: That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
(11:40:00 AM) Romeo: And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
(12:00:00 PM) Romeo: Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
(12:20:00 PM) Romeo: For fear of that I still will stay with thee
(12:40:00 PM) Romeo: And never from this palace of dim night
(01:00:00 PM) Romeo: Depart again. Here, here will I remain
(01:20:00 PM) Romeo: With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
(01:40:00 PM) Romeo: Will I set up my everlasting rest
(02:00:00 PM) Romeo: And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
(02:20:00 PM) Romeo: From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
(02:40:00 PM) Romeo: Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
(03:00:00 PM) Romeo: The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
(03:20:00 PM) Romeo: A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
(03:40:00 PM) Romeo: Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
(04:00:00 PM) Romeo: Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
(04:20:00 PM) Romeo: The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
(04:40:00 PM) Romeo: Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
(05:00:00 PM) Romeo: Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
