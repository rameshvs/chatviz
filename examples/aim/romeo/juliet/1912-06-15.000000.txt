Conversation with Juliet at Sat 15 Jun 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: That almost freezes up the heat of life.
(12:40:00 AM) Juliet: I'll call them back again to comfort me.
(01:00:00 AM) Juliet: Nurse!- What should she do here?
(01:20:00 AM) Juliet: My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
(01:40:00 AM) Juliet: Come, vial.
(02:00:00 AM) Juliet: What if this mixture do not work at all?
(02:20:00 AM) Juliet: Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
(02:40:00 AM) Juliet: No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
(03:00:00 AM) Juliet: Lays down a dagger.
(03:20:00 AM) Juliet: What if it be a poison which the friar
(03:40:00 AM) Juliet: Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
(04:00:00 AM) Juliet: Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
(04:20:00 AM) Juliet: Because he married me before to Romeo?
(04:40:00 AM) Juliet: I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
(05:00:00 AM) Juliet: For he hath still been tried a holy man.
(05:20:00 AM) Juliet: I will not entertain so bad a thought.
(05:40:00 AM) Juliet: How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
(06:00:00 AM) Juliet: I wake before the time that Romeo
(06:20:00 AM) Juliet: Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
(06:40:00 AM) Juliet: Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
(07:00:00 AM) Juliet: To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
(07:20:00 AM) Juliet: And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
(07:40:00 AM) Juliet: Or, if I live, is it not very like
(08:00:00 AM) Juliet: The horrible conceit of death and night,
(08:20:00 AM) Juliet: Together with the terror of the place-
(08:40:00 AM) Juliet: As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
(09:00:00 AM) Juliet: Where for this many hundred years the bones
(09:20:00 AM) Juliet: Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
(09:40:00 AM) Juliet: Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
(10:00:00 AM) Juliet: Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
(10:20:00 AM) Juliet: At some hours in the night spirits resort-
(10:40:00 AM) Juliet: Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
(11:00:00 AM) Juliet: So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
(11:20:00 AM) Juliet: And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
(11:40:00 AM) Juliet: That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
(12:00:00 PM) Juliet: O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
(12:20:00 PM) Juliet: Environed with all these hideous fears,
(12:40:00 PM) Juliet: And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
(01:00:00 PM) Juliet: And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
(01:20:00 PM) Juliet: And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
(01:40:00 PM) Juliet: As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
(02:00:00 PM) Juliet: O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
(02:20:00 PM) Juliet: Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
(02:40:00 PM) Juliet: Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
(03:00:00 PM) Juliet: Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
