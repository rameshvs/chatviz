Conversation with Juliet at Wed 12 Jun 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
(12:40:00 AM) Juliet: Or shall I come to you at evening mass
(03:40:00 AM) Juliet:  O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
(04:00:00 AM) Juliet: Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
(06:20:00 AM) Juliet:  Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
(06:40:00 AM) Juliet: Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
(07:00:00 AM) Juliet: If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
(07:20:00 AM) Juliet: Do thou but call my resolution wise
(07:40:00 AM) Juliet: And with this knife I'll help it presently.
(08:00:00 AM) Juliet: God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
(08:20:00 AM) Juliet: And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
(08:40:00 AM) Juliet: Shall be the label to another deed,
(09:00:00 AM) Juliet: Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
(09:20:00 AM) Juliet: Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
(09:40:00 AM) Juliet: Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
(10:00:00 AM) Juliet: Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
(10:20:00 AM) Juliet: 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
(10:40:00 AM) Juliet: Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
(11:00:00 AM) Juliet: Which the commission of thy years and art
(11:20:00 AM) Juliet: Could to no issue of true honour bring.
(11:40:00 AM) Juliet: Be not so long to speak. I long to die
(12:00:00 PM) Juliet: If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
(04:00:00 PM) Juliet:  O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
(04:20:00 PM) Juliet: From off the battlements of yonder tower,
(04:40:00 PM) Juliet: Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
(05:00:00 PM) Juliet: Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
(05:20:00 PM) Juliet: Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
(05:40:00 PM) Juliet: O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
(06:00:00 PM) Juliet: With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
(06:20:00 PM) Juliet: Or bid me go into a new-made grave
(06:40:00 PM) Juliet: And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
(07:00:00 PM) Juliet: Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
(07:20:00 PM) Juliet: And I will do it without fear or doubt,
(07:40:00 PM) Juliet: To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
