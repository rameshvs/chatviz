(02:40:00 AM) Juliet:  I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
(03:00:00 AM) Juliet: But no more deep will I endart mine eye
(03:20:00 AM) Juliet: Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
(12:00:00 PM) Romeo:  What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
(12:20:00 PM) Romeo: Or shall we on without apology?
(04:00:00 PM) Romeo:  Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
(04:20:00 PM) Romeo: Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
(05:40:00 PM) Romeo:  Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
(06:00:00 PM) Romeo: With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead

(09:00:00 PM) Romeo: Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
(10:40:00 PM) Romeo:  Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
(11:00:00 PM) Romeo: Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
