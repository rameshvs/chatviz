(12:40:00 AM) Juliet:  Feeling so the loss,
(01:00:00 AM) Juliet: I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
(02:40:00 AM) Juliet:  What villain, madam?
(04:00:00 AM) Juliet:  [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
(04:20:00 AM) Juliet: God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
(04:40:00 AM) Juliet: And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
(06:00:00 AM) Juliet:  Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
(06:20:00 AM) Juliet: Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
(09:20:00 AM) Juliet:  Indeed I never shall be satisfied
(09:40:00 AM) Juliet: With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
(10:00:00 AM) Juliet: Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
(10:20:00 AM) Juliet: Madam, if you could find out but a man
(10:40:00 AM) Juliet: To bear a poison, I would temper it;
(11:00:00 AM) Juliet: That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
(11:20:00 AM) Juliet: Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
(11:40:00 AM) Juliet: To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
(12:00:00 PM) Juliet: To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
(12:20:00 PM) Juliet: Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
(02:00:00 PM) Juliet:  And joy comes well in such a needy time.
(02:20:00 PM) Juliet: What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
(04:40:00 PM) Juliet:  Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
(07:00:00 PM) Juliet:  Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
(07:20:00 PM) Juliet: He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
(07:40:00 PM) Juliet: I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
(08:00:00 PM) Juliet: Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
(08:20:00 PM) Juliet: I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
(08:40:00 PM) Juliet: I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
(09:00:00 PM) Juliet: It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
(09:20:00 PM) Juliet: Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
