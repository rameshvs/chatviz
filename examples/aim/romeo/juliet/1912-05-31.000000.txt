Conversation with Juliet at Fri 31 May 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
(12:40:00 AM) Juliet: That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
(01:00:00 AM) Juliet: Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
(01:20:00 AM) Juliet: Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
(01:40:00 AM) Juliet: By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
(02:00:00 AM) Juliet: It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
(02:20:00 AM) Juliet: Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
(02:40:00 AM) Juliet: And learn me how to lose a winning match,
(03:00:00 AM) Juliet: Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
(03:20:00 AM) Juliet: Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
(03:40:00 AM) Juliet: With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
(04:00:00 AM) Juliet: Think true love acted simple modesty.
(04:20:00 AM) Juliet: Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
(04:40:00 AM) Juliet: For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
(05:00:00 AM) Juliet: Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
(05:20:00 AM) Juliet: Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
(05:40:00 AM) Juliet: Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
(06:00:00 AM) Juliet: Take him and cut him out in little stars,
(06:20:00 AM) Juliet: And he will make the face of heaven so fine
(06:40:00 AM) Juliet: That all the world will be in love with night
(07:00:00 AM) Juliet: And pay no worship to the garish sun.
(07:20:00 AM) Juliet: O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
(07:40:00 AM) Juliet: But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
(08:00:00 AM) Juliet: Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
(08:20:00 AM) Juliet: As is the night before some festival
(08:40:00 AM) Juliet: To an impatient child that hath new robes
(09:00:00 AM) Juliet: And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
(01:00:00 PM) Juliet:  Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
(03:00:00 PM) Juliet:  Can heaven be so envious?
(05:00:00 PM) Juliet:  What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
(05:20:00 PM) Juliet: This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
(05:40:00 PM) Juliet: Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
(06:00:00 PM) Juliet: And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
(06:20:00 PM) Juliet: Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
(06:40:00 PM) Juliet: I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
(07:00:00 PM) Juliet: Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
(07:20:00 PM) Juliet: If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
(07:40:00 PM) Juliet: Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
(10:20:00 PM) Juliet:  O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
(10:40:00 PM) Juliet: To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
(11:00:00 PM) Juliet: Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
(11:20:00 PM) Juliet: And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
