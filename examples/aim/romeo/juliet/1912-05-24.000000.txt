Conversation with Juliet at Fri 24 May 1912 12:00:00 AM on Romeo
(01:00:00 AM) Romeo:  What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
(02:40:00 AM) Romeo:  I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
(06:20:00 AM) Romeo:  Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
(08:40:00 AM) Romeo:  Commend me to thy lady.
(02:40:00 PM) Juliet:  The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
(03:00:00 PM) Juliet: In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
(03:20:00 PM) Juliet: Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
(03:40:00 PM) Juliet: O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
(04:00:00 PM) Juliet: Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
(04:20:00 PM) Juliet: Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
(04:40:00 PM) Juliet: Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
(05:00:00 PM) Juliet: And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
(05:20:00 PM) Juliet: Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
(05:40:00 PM) Juliet: Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
(06:00:00 PM) Juliet: Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
(06:20:00 PM) Juliet: Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
(06:40:00 PM) Juliet: She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
(07:00:00 PM) Juliet: My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
(07:20:00 PM) Juliet: And his to me,
(07:40:00 PM) Juliet: But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
(08:00:00 PM) Juliet: Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
(11:20:00 PM) Juliet:  Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
(11:40:00 PM) Juliet: Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
(12:00:00 AM) Juliet: If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: By playing it to me with so sour a face.
