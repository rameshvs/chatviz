(10:20:00 AM) Romeo:  If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
(10:40:00 AM) Romeo: My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
(11:00:00 AM) Romeo: My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
(11:20:00 AM) Romeo: And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
(11:40:00 AM) Romeo: Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
(12:00:00 PM) Romeo: I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
(12:20:00 PM) Romeo: (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
(12:40:00 PM) Romeo: And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
(01:00:00 PM) Romeo: That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
(01:20:00 PM) Romeo: Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
(01:40:00 PM) Romeo: When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
(07:40:00 PM) Romeo:  Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
(08:00:00 PM) Romeo: Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
(08:20:00 PM) Romeo: And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
(10:20:00 PM) Romeo:  Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
(10:40:00 PM) Romeo: Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
(11:00:00 PM) Romeo: Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
(12:20:00 AM) Romeo:  No matter. Get thee gone
