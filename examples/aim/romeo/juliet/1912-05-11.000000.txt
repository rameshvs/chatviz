(08:20:00 AM) Romeo:  [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
(08:40:00 AM) Romeo: hand Of yonder knight?
(10:00:00 AM) Romeo:  O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
(10:20:00 AM) Romeo: It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
(10:40:00 AM) Romeo: Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
(11:00:00 AM) Romeo: Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
(11:20:00 AM) Romeo: So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
(11:40:00 AM) Romeo: As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
(12:00:00 PM) Romeo: The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
(12:20:00 PM) Romeo: And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
(12:40:00 PM) Romeo: Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
(01:00:00 PM) Romeo: For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
