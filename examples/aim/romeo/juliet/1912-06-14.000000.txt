(02:40:00 AM) Juliet:  I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
(03:00:00 AM) Juliet: And gave him what becomed love I might,
(03:20:00 AM) Juliet: Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
(06:00:00 AM) Juliet:  Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
(06:20:00 AM) Juliet: To help me sort such needful ornaments
(06:40:00 AM) Juliet: As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
(04:40:00 PM) Juliet:  Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
(05:00:00 PM) Juliet: I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
(05:20:00 PM) Juliet: For I have need of many orisons
(05:40:00 PM) Juliet: To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
(06:00:00 PM) Juliet: Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
(08:20:00 PM) Juliet:  No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
(08:40:00 PM) Juliet: As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
(09:00:00 PM) Juliet: So please you, let me now be left alone,
(09:20:00 PM) Juliet: And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
(09:40:00 PM) Juliet: For I am sure you have your hands full all
(10:00:00 PM) Juliet: In this so sudden business.
(12:00:00 AM) Juliet:  Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
(12:20:00 AM) Juliet: I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
